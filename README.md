# cat-budgeting-site
<h1>Helps you look over your spendings and split your budget on categories</h1>
Meant to be something you fire up at the end of the month to see how much you spent
Split in 4 distinct categories: Delivery, Going Out, Groceries and Other (My personal top 4)

Extra features:
Ability to add in money that you received (helpful for dinners where u paid and ppl sent u part of the bill back :D)
Ability to add notes! Great for noting things down you want to remind youself next time you sit down and budgetyour expenses
